Goals for next release:
-----------------------
* Type check object access based on possible types
* Improve handling when importing packages

Longer Term goals:
------------------
* Warn about integer division (possible semantic change in python versions)
* Make check for 'self' a list instead of a string
* Check function return values - partially complete
* Add check for unreachable code
* Add check for a[1,2] for lists (ok for dict)
* Add check for except: pass
* Add check that private functions are used in module/class
* Add check that subclass overrides method that only raises NotImplementedError
* Add check for using object members outside of class
* Fix deriving from class by alias name

* Allow import checker to catch errors, rather than starting checker.py
* Find lines that end w/semi-colons (;)
* Spell check doc strings

Eric's code review:

* Fix (for i in list: if i in other_list: continue) by using filter func
	(need to fix warn.py:find()/blacklist)
* would it be simpler to treat self.f() as f(self)?
* warn.py: _addWarning can be removed by using list flattening?
* checker.py:  use one list for warnings (remove importWarnings)?
* Consider i18n for cfg strings, warnings, etc.
* use %(name)s expansion for warnings
