Goals for next release:
-----------------------
* Improve handling when importing packages
* Check object method calls for # args
* Add check for magic #s/consts
	(need dict of consts, count, max count, consts to ignore)
* Add check for unsupported operand type(s) for * + / etc

Longer Term goals:
------------------
* Check object method calls for # args for builtin type methods
* Store types of globals, class attributes, function & method return values
* Add original line warnings for those that refer to another place
	(e.g., overridden method doesn't match signature)
* Add capability to check features from a specified version of python
	which is different from runtime interpreter
* Security checks for known issues.  Adrian Likins @redhat recommends 
  looking at http://www.securesw.com/rats/
* Recursive calls to __repr__ implementations
* Make check for 'self' a list instead of a string
* Check function return values - partially complete
* Add check for unreachable code
* Add check for except: pass
* Add check that private functions are used in module/class
* Add check that subclass overrides method that only raises NotImplementedError
* Add check for using object members outside of class
* Add check for implicit string concatentation
* Fix deriving from class by alias name

* Allow import checker to catch errors, rather than starting checker.py
* Find lines that end w/semi-colons (;)
* Spell check doc strings
