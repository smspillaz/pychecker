* Add check for multiple functions/methods/classes w/same name
* Add check when using method as an attribute (if method and x == y:)
* Add check that private functions are used in module/class
* Fix deriving from class by alias name
* Fix checking files in standard library before local file
* Fix sys.exc_value, etc. generating No attribute warning in except clause
* Check function return values - partially complete
* Finer grain control of warnings/config options (per module/class/method)
* Allow import checker to catch errors, rather than starting checker.py
* Find lines that end w/semi-colons (;)
* Spell check doc strings

Eric's code review:

* Fix (for i in list: if i in other_list: continue) by using filter func
	(need to fix warn.py:find()/blacklist)
* would it be simpler to treat self.f() as f(self)?
* warn.py: _addWarning can be removed by using list flattening?
* checker.py:  use one list for warnings (remove importWarnings)?
* Consider i18n for cfg strings, warnings, etc.
* use %(name)s expansion for warnings
