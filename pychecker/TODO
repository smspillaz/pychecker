Goals for next minor release (0.8.7):
-------------------------------------
* Add/fix/finish check for unreachable code
* Fix test20.py:28 handle local types for return:
        c = (1, 2)
        if c: return c
        return (3, 4)

Goals for next major release (0.9):
-----------------------------------
* Improve handling when importing packages (ie, don't import modules)
  - Make a base class to handle stack operations
  - Override base class with classes to handle module scope, functions, etc.
  - Process module and create Module/Class/Function objects w/o dir(), etc.

* Check code in nested scopes - partially done (handles lambdas)
	(get rid of unused warnings for identifiers used in nested scopes)
	(see test64)
* Fix most of the FIXMEs

Longer Term goals:
------------------
* Add check for magic #s/consts
	(need dict of consts, count, max count, consts to ignore)
* Add check for unsupported operand type(s) for * + / etc
* Store types of globals, class attributes, function & method return values
* Output stats about pychecker's job, good, bad, otherwise...
	annotate code for problem areas, well checked areas, etc.
* Handle slots in Python 2.2
* Add original line warnings for those that refer to another place
	(e.g., overridden method doesn't match signature)
* Add capability to check features from a specified version of python
	which is different from runtime interpreter
* Security checks for known issues.  Adrian Likins @redhat recommends 
  looking at http://www.securesw.com/rats/
* When checking for unused vars, var list should be prefixes/regexes
* Make check for 'self' a list instead of a string
* Check function return values - partially complete
* Add check that an assert is not passed a tuple
* Add check that private functions are used in module/class
* Add check that subclass overrides method that only raises NotImplementedError
* Add check for using object members outside of class
* Add portability checks for win32/unix
* Fix deriving from class by alias name

* Add check if __getattr[ibute]__ returns None (instead of raising an exception)
* Add check for except: pass
* Add check for implicit string concatentation
* Add check for creating tuple when don't want a tuple, like: 1,
            or not creating tuple when want one, like: (1)

* Allow import checker to catch errors, rather than starting checker.py
* Find lines that end w/semi-colons (;)
* Spell check doc strings
