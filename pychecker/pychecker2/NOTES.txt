This is a re-write of pychecker using traditional parse tree
techniques, rather than the bytecode.

There are some other design changes, related to Warning objects and
Option handling.  In general, pychecker2 tries to distribute checks to
separate classes.  These classes are more self-contained: they hold
onto the option variables and define the Warning objects they support.

Items still missing:

        Error suppression (errors may be suppressed globally)

        Module imports:
                from sys import *
                def f():
                     stdout.write('Hello\n')

            now gives an 'unknown identifier "stdout"'

        Line numbers for where identifiers are defined.
            (This will probably entail a re-write of 
             compiler.symbol.SymbolVisitor)

        Typing of any kind:
             consistent return types
             consistent return styles (mplicit and explicit)
             object members
             object methods

        New python features:
             slots
             properties
             integer division

        Complexity

        Doc strings
