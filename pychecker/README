PyChecker is a python source code checking tool to help you find
common bugs.  It is meant to find problems that are typically caught
by a compiler.  Because of the dynamic nature of python, some warnings
may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent.

PyChecker works in a combination of ways.  First, it imports each
module.  If there is an import error, the module cannot be processed.
The import provides some basic information about the module.  For each
function, class, and method, the code within the function is checked
for possible problems.

Types of problems that can be found include:

  * No doc strings in modules, classes, functions, and methods
  * self not the first parameter to a method
  * Wrong number of parameters passed to functions/methods
  * No global found (e.g., using a module without importing it)
  * Global not used (module or variable)


To use PyChecker, pass the python source files you want to check on
the command line:

	python $PY_CHECKER_HOME/checker.py file1.py file2.py ...

If there are import dependencies in your source files, you should
import those files first on the command line in order to get as many
files checked as possible.


PyChecker should work with Python 1.5.2 and 2.0.


To look at a little example, you can use the test files included:

	python checker.py test_input/*.py


Good Luck!  As always, feedback is greatly appreciated.
